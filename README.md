# Learning

Hello. My name is Dhruv Dhaduk. I am creating web pages in this repository to learn web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I am not using any framework for now. It's just vanilla HTML, CSS, JS for now. And I also don't using any backend for now. It will be just static web pages.

Here is the link to view all my web pages : [dhruv-dhaduk.github.io/html](https://dhruv-dhaduk.github.io/html/)
